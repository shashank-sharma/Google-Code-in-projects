Keeping it simple is really a nice idea and it is also not<span class="_ _0"></span> </div><div class="t m0 x2 h2 yb ff2 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">that complicated. In my opinion they wanted logo to be simple and less complicated also they wanted<span class="_ _1"></span> </div><div class="t m0 x2 h2 yc ff2 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">to put the same color blue from the previous logo. And I think they wanted to break that tradition of </div><div class="t m0 x2 h2 yd ff2 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">old logo and wanted to start something new which symbolizes the power of Ubuntu GNOME. </div><div class="t m0 x2 h2 ye ff2 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">According to me they also wanted to give it a touch of Ubuntu and if you notice that character ‘ u ‘ is </div><div class="t m0 x2 h2 yf ff2 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">totally same as you can see it in ‘u‘ in Ubuntu font family. Even I tried to crop the character ‘u’ from </div><div class="t m0 x2 h2 y10 ff2 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">ubuntu font family  and tried to place it on that white space and you can see the result that it </div><div class="t m0 x2 h2 y11 ff2 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">completely overlap with that logo. </div><div class="t m0 x2 h2 y12 ff2 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Ubuntu GNOME has changed its logo just because the previous logo was pretty much </div><div class="t m0 x2 h2 y13 ff2 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">similar to that of GNOME but the main difference was only that in previous version of </div><div class="t m0 x2 h2 y14 ff2 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Ubuntu GNOME logo there was blue color and it was in circle, but in GNOME it was black<span class="_ _0"></span> </div><div class="t m0 x2 h2 y15 ff2 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">white so overall it was similar so that’s why they may have changed it. To be very honest, </div><div class="t m0 x2 h2 y16 ff2 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">after seeing this logo few person might think of what this new logo representing but when I </div><div class="t m0 x2 h2 y17 ff2 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">have given a deep thought then I understand few things: </div><div class="t m0 x2 h2 y18 ff2 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">First there is no doubt that the lowest character represent ‘ u ’ (the one which is showing </div><div class="t m0 x2 h2 y19 ff2 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">time like 11 o’clock). But the second one might seems like ‘ u ’ but it is not. The character ‘ u ‘ has it<span class="_ _1"></span> </div><div class="t m0 x2 h2 y1a ff2 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">both ends at same level but in this case the right one is longer as compared to the left one so, one </div><div class="t m0 x2 h2 y1b ff2 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">thing is sure that it is not ‘u’. So what I think is that it is representing ‘ G ’ and it also little bit look like ‘ </div><div class="t m0 x2 h2 y1c ff2 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">G ‘ and now it make even sense that ‘ u ‘ represent Ubuntu and ‘ G ‘ represent GNOME and together in </div><div class="t m0 x2 h2 y1d ff2 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">one logo it shows Ubuntu GNOME. Though it was not hard to guess and I guess it’s pretty nice to show<span class="_ _1"></span> </div><div class="t m0 x2 h2 y1e ff2 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">it like this.<span class="_ _0"></span> </div><div class="t m0 x2 h2 y1f ff2 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Some of them may debate that is not ‘ G ‘ and I totally agree with them but still since it is Ubuntu<span class="_ _0"></span> </div><div class="t m0 x2 h2 y20 ff2 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">GNOME logo then they will use only Ubuntu font family. But if we see small character ‘g’ and capital </div><div class="t m0 x2 h2 y21 ff2 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">character ’G’ in ubuntu font family then there is no way they can combine and make it a logo as it </div><div class="t m0 x2 h2 y22 ff2 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">would be much complicated and it might look bad so they just used character ‘u’ and extend one end </div><div class="t m0 x2 h2 y23 ff2 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">little bit so that it looks like ‘G’. And by doing this it become nice, simple, less complicated, attractive<span class="_ _1"></span> </div><div class="t m0 x2 h2 y24 ff2 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">and most important with Ubuntu touch in it. Still with so many open source operating system it is hard<span class="_ _1"></span> </div><div class="t m0 x2 h2 y25 ff2 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">to say that I will choose only this OS for my linux machine after seeing this logo. But since it will be a </div><div class="t m0 x2 h2 y26 ff2 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">new logo for me so I may try to download it and see what are the features of this OS but still some </div><div class="t m0 x2 h2 y27 ff2 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">them may try download it after seeing this new logo. </div><div class="t m0 x2 h2 y28 ff2 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">If it comes to recommending someone then I will strongly recommend to try it once and I would </div><div class="t m0 x2 h2 y29 ff2 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">definitely want to show my friends that how productive this OS is. And also by seeing this logo some </div><div class="t m0 x2 h2 y2a ff2 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">of my friends may think that if the logo is good then OS will be good as well. So overall I don’t think </div><div class="t m0 x2 h2 y2b ff2 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">this logo is bad at all<span class="ff3 fs0"><span class="_ _2"></span><span class="ff1">.</span></span></div></div><div class="pi" data-data='{"ctm":[1.000000,0.000000,0.000000,1.000000,0.000000,0.000000]}'></div></div>
