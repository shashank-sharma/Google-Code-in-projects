<h1>Introduction to Kivy</h1>
</div>

<div id="section">
<br>
<p> Kivy is an open source Python library for developing applications which make use of innovative user interface which makes it different from other
applications. Kivy runs on many OS like Linux, Windows, OS X, Android and iOS. The most important thing is that you can run same code in all OS which
are listed here. Kivy is written in Python and Cython.</p>According to me Kivy is an application which can help us to create something innovative much easily and something which can be easily appreciated by other
just because of his great user interface. It provide a whole new tool set which you can use easily and if it is used wisely then there is no doubt we can create something which can affect many people and help them. 
According to me I would like to work on Ubuntu GNOME because I currently use it and it would be seeing how it works. Kivy is not that hard to use even though it requires coding but if we take a crash course of how to use
Kivy then it will be really productive for you and then you can create something new. There are bunch of projects available at offcial website of kivy
which you can take a look at it.
 But then one question arises is what we can do with Kivy.<hr>
Well there are so many things which we can do:
<ol>
<li> Creating application with good User Interface</li>
<li>Usage of Canvas</li>
<li>Making a Demo applicaiton like for showing pictures</li>
<li>Using camera to do something</li>
<li>Creating multi-touch application</li>
<li>3d rendering for creating 3d objects</li>
<a href="http://kivy.org/#gallery"> And many more ...</a>
</ol>
<br>
What I would like to do is I want use Kivy to create wallet kind of application where I can store loads of information and security numbers with high security.
I would like to make that application with good User interface. Overall according to me kivy is an application which can help you to create
application with great user interface.
