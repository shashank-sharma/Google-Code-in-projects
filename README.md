#Welcome

All the work done here is a part of my GCI task and you can see all my project link below:

Summary of my blog: In my blog which is mentioned below consist of information about me and all the links about the GCI task which
I have did with the help of FOSSASIA organization. Special thanks to mentors of FOSSASIA for supporting and helping me 
to do something which was looking impossible. There are many updates which I have made day-by-day and I hope you will like my page.

From 10th January I got my academics exam so from that onwards I stopped contributing so these are the only task which I have did so far.

Though I am not a professional in working with HTML and CSS but I tried my best to make it attractive.

There are many issues which I kept on searching in all my project and made them available here so that I may not forget about them.
If you want to contribute anything then please do help you can see all this issues available.

Links of my all GCI task are as follows:

####[Hangman](http://shashank-sharma.github.io/hangman.html)
(In case of Hangman game the UI is not so good. I write the whole js file behind the hangman on my own and at that time I was having 1 day experience only so I was able to make it just working. But still after making that game I got to learn so many things about how javascript works. I was also going to make the UI much attractive but I only focused on .js file only.)
