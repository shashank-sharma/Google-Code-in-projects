# Welcome

All the work done here is a part of my GCI task and you can see all my project link below:

From 10th January I got my academics exam so from that onwards I stopped contributing so these are the only task which I have did so far.

Though I am not a professional and also its my first time working on HTML and CSS. Because of so many task of FOSSASIA I was able to learn how to use github and how to manage projects and also helps me to learn python and go language.

Summary of my blog: In my blog which is mentioned below consist of information about me and all the links about the GCI task which
I have did with the help of FOSSASIA organization. Special thanks to mentors of FOSSASIA for supporting and helping me 
to do something which was looking impossible. There are many updates which I have made day-by-day and I hope you will like my page.

#### [Hangman](https://shashank-sharma.github.io/Google-Code-in-projects/hangman.html)
(In case of Hangman game the UI is not so good. I write the whole js file behind the hangman on my own and at that time I was having 1 day experience only so I was able to make it just working. But still after making that game I got to learn so many things about how javascript works. I was also going to make the UI much attractive but I only focused on .js file only.)
